# ðŸ§  JavaScript Algorithms & Array Exercises

Welcome to my collection of **JavaScript algorithm and array manipulation exercises**.  
These tasks cover core programming concepts such as loops, arrays, objects, and higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`).

All exercises were implemented with ES6+ syntax, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and mastering fundamental JavaScript operations.

## ðŸ“¦ Exercises

### ðŸ”¹ Simple Algorithms
- **Factorial**: Implemented `factorialIterativo(n)` using a `for` loop to calculate the factorial of a number.  
- **Fibonacci**: Implemented `fibonacciArray(n)` to return the first `n` Fibonacci numbers in an array.  
- **CRUD on Arrays**: Managed an array of book objects (`books`) with Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

### ðŸ”¹ Array Manipulation with map, filter, reduce
- **map**: Converted an array of strings to uppercase.  
- **filter**: Extracted numbers greater than 30 from an array.  
- **reduce**: Calculated the total sum of an array of prices.  
- **map + filter (combined)**: Filtered objects based on age and extracted names into a new array.  
- **reduce (word count)**: Counted occurrences of items in an array and returned an object with frequencies.
